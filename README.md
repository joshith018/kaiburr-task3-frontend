# Kaiburr - Task 3: React WEB UI

This project is a frontend web application built with React, TypeScript, and Ant Design. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the [Task 1 Backend API](https://github.com/your-username/kaiburr-task1-backend) (replace this link with your own).

Users can view, search, create, and delete tasks.

## Features

* View all tasks in a sortable and searchable table.
* Create new tasks using a popup modal form.
